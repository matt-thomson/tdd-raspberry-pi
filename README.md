Only user stories 1 and 2 are implemented at present

## User Stories ##

1. When I press the button, a single drink is dispensed in the bin.
2. When an item lands in the bin, the LED is switched on; when the bin is emptied, the LED is switched off.
3. When I press the button and there is something in the bin, nothing is dispensed.  The LED blinks 3 times.
4. When the machine is idle, the LED blinks every second.
